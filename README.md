# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local
congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote,

## Resources

- Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
There were "x" votes cast in the election.

The candidates were:
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)

Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The winner of the election was:
Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes totalling 73.8% of the overall vote.


## Challenge Overview
This challenge was specifically based on creating another set of dictonaries and lists to be able to review the voter county turnout and the highest county turnout throughout this election.

The results were:
- Denver having 82.8% of the vote, or 306,055 votes
- Jefferson having 10.5% of the votes or 38,855 votes
- Arapahoe having 6.7% of the vote or 24,801 votes

## Challenge Summary
Being able to analyze 369,712 rows of data so quickly was something very unique and interesting to me. I enjoyed being able to go through the lines of code and having set dictonaries to refer back to in order to make this an easier task. I struggled getting my code to line up and having paths work directly into the location in my computer, but that was one of the few difficulties I had. Going through this project methodically made sense to me and I enjoyed it a lot.
